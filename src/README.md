# Modules

## Contributing new modules

A few conventions can be found below:

- each file must have the `.bash` extension
- each file must start with `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- each file represents a namespace that should be called accordingly (e.g., `foo.bash` should define the `foo::*` namespace)
- each file should have one `[namespace]::_internal_check_deps()` function that checks if all required dependencies in that module are available at runtime
- namespaces and functions that start with `_` are private and cannot be called via the executor script
- `base::check_deps()` is a reserved name and is automatically generated by [scripts/generate-dist.sh](../scripts/generate-dist.sh); it will run `[namespace]::_internal_check_deps()` for each defined namespace and is meant to be used for confirming that any function defined in the `releasetools` library will function correctly
